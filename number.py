# An integer or `int` is a whole number. 
# It has no decimal point and contains all counting numbers `(1, 2, 3, …)` as well as their negative counterparts and the number 0. 
# If you were counting the number of people in a room, the number of jellybeans in a jar, or the number of keys on a keyboard you would likely use an integer.

# A floating-point number, or a `float` is a decimal number. 
# It can be used to represent fractional quantities as well as precise measurements. 
# If you were measuring the length of your bedroom wall, calculating the average test score of a seventh-grade class, or storing a baseball player’s batting average for the 1998 season you would likely use a float.

# Numbers can be assigned to variables or used literally in a program:    

```
an_int = 2 
a_float = 2.1

print(an_int + 3)
# Output: 5
```   

# an integer
# a float
# 3 is a literal, meaning it’s actually the number 3 and not a variable with the number 3 assigned to it.
