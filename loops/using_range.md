**For Loops: Using Range**
For example, if we wanted to print out a `"Learning Loops!"` message six times using a for `loop`, we would follow this structure:
```
for <temporary variable> in <list of length 6>:
  print("Learning Loops!")
```

Notice that we need to iterate through a list with a length of six, but we donâ€™t necessarily care what is inside of the list.
To create arbitrary collections of any length, we can pair our `for` loops with the trusty Python built-in function `range()`.

An example of how the `range()` function works, this code generates a collection of `6` integer elements from `0` to `5`:
```
six_steps = range(6)
 
# six_steps is now a collection with 6 elements:
# 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

We can then use the range directly in our `for` loops as the collection to perform a six-step iteration:
```
for temp in range(6):
  print("Learning Loops!")
```

Would output:
```
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
```

Something to note is we are not using `temp` anywhere inside of the loop body. If we are curious about which loop iteration (step) we are on, 
we can use `temp` to track it. Since our range starts at `0`, we will add `+ 1` to our `temp` to represent how many iterations (steps) our loop takes more accurately.
```
for temp in range(6):
  print("Loop is on iteration number " + str(temp + 1))
```

Would output:
```
Loop is on iteration number 1
Loop is on iteration number 2
Loop is on iteration number 3
Loop is on iteration number 4
Loop is on iteration number 5
Loop is on iteration number 6
```
