In this lesson, we have learned about the `three types` of Python errors:

* `SyntaxError`: Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language.
* `NameError`: Errors reported when the interpreter detects an object that is unknown.
* `TypeError`: Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.

There is also another type of error that doesn’t have error messages that we will cover down the line:

* `Logic errors`: Errors found by the programmer when the program isn’t doing what it is intending to do.
