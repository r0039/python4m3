The story goes that on September 9th, 1947, computer scientist Grace Hopper found a moth in the Harvard Mark II computer’s logbook and reported the world’s first literal computer bug. 
However, the term “bug,” in the sense of technical error, dates back at least to 1878 and with Thomas Edison.

In Python, there are many different ways of classifying errors, but here are some common ones:
** SyntaxError: Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language.
** NameError: Errors reported when the interpreter detects a variable that is unknown.
** TypeError: Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
