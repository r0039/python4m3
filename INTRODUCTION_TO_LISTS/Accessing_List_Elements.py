"""
In Python, we call the location of an element in a list its index.

Python lists are zero-indexed. This means that the first element in a list has index 0, rather than 1.

Here are the index numbers for the list calls:
Element	Index
"Juan"	0
"Zofia"	1
"Amare"	2
"Ezio"	3
"Ananya"	4

In this example, the element with index 2 is "Amare".

We can select a single element from a list by using square brackets ([]) and the index of the list item. 
If we wanted to select the third element from the list, weâ€™d use calls[2]:

print(calls[2])

Will output:
Amare

Note: When accessing elements of an list, you must use an int as the index. If you use a float, you will get an error. This can be especially tricky when using division. For example print(calls[4/2]) will result in an error, because 4/2 gets evaluated to the float 2.0.

To solve this problem, you can force the result of your division to be an int by using the int() function. 
int() takes a number and cuts off the decimal point. For example, int(5.9) and int(5.0) will both become 5. Therefore, calls[int(4/2)] will result in the same value as calls[2], whereas calls[4/2] will result in an error.
