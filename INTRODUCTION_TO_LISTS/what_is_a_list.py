"""
In programming, it is common to want to work with collections of data. 
In Python, a list is one of the many built-in data structures that allows us to work with a collection of data in sequential order.

Suppose we want to make a list of the heights of students in a class:

* Noelle is 61 inches tall
* Ava is 70 inches tall
* Sam is 67 inches tall
* Mia is 64 inches tall
In Python, we can create a variable called heights to store these integers into a list:

heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]

Notice that:

1/ A list begins and ends with square brackets ([ and ]).
2/ Each item (i.e., 67 or 70) is separated by a comma (,)
3/ Itâ€™s considered good practice to insert a space () after each comma, but your code will run just fine if you forget the space.
"""

heights = [61, 70, 67, 64, 65]
print(heights)

broken_heights = [65, 71, 59, 62]
print(broken_heights)

list_tring = ["aha", "aho", "ahi"]
print(list_tring)
