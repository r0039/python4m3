**Working with Lists** 

Now that we know how to create and access list data, we can start to explore additional ways of working with lists.  

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to:
* Add and remove items from a list using a specific index.
* Create lists with continuous values.
* Get the length of a list.
* Select portions of a list (called slicing).
* Count the number of times that an element appears in a list.
* Sort a list of items.

Note: In some of the exercises, we will be using built-in functions in Python. If you haven’t yet explored the concept of a function, it may look a bit new. Below we compare it to the method syntax we learned in the earlier lesson.

Here is a preview:
```
# Example syntax for methods
list.method(input)
 
# Example syntax for a built-in function 
builtinfuncion(input)
```
