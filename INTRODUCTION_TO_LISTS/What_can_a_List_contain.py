"""
Lists can contain more than just numbers.

Let’s revisit our classroom example with heights:

Noelle is 61 inches tall
Ava is 70 inches tall
Sam is 67 inches tall
Mia is 64 inches tall

Instead of storing each student’s height, we can make a list that contains their names:
names = ["Noelle", "Ava", "Sam", "Mia"]

We can even combine multiple data types in one list. For example, this list contains both a string and an integer:
mixed_list_string_number = ["Noelle", 61]

Lists can contain any data type in Python! For example, this list contains a string, integer, boolean, and float.
mixed_list_common = ["Mia", 27, False, 0.5]

ints_and_strings = [1, 2, 3, "four", "five", "hallo"]
print(ints_and_strings)

sam_height_and_testscore = ["Sam", 67, 85.5, True]
print(sam_height_and_testscore)
