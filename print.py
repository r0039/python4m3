# using print() to print something 

# print these messages 
print("hello world!")

# this print doesn't work, because doulbe quotes doesn't present this way. 
#print("hello hello "hello hello"")

# double quotes present by using double quotes in single quote. 
print('hello "hello hello"')

# also, I can use "\"message\""
print("hello, this is \"a new quote\"")

# or double escapes 
print("The escape character is \\.")
